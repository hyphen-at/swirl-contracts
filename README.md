# Swirl Contracts

This repository contains contract codes of Swirl, a mobile nametag NFT sharing service leveraging [Nearby Interaction](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction) and appless & walletless onboarding.

It uses a special protocol called **Proof-of-Meeting** to verify that the participants are at the same time & location by signing their locations and exchange the signatures through Nearby Communication protocol.
